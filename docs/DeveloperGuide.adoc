== Introduction

Welcome to the *Dr. Duke* developer guide! This document assumes a familiarity with the link:UserGuide.adoc[user guide].

In order to be a successful *Dr. Duke* developer, you need a general understanding of: +

* *Dr. Duke*'s architecture and object model
* The Java framework which *Dr. Duke* builds on

== Setting up
=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `11`* or above
. *IntelliJ* IDE
+

NOTE: IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +

This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* shown above explains the high-level design of *Dr. Duke*.

[[Design-UI]]
=== UI
image::plantuml/ui.svg[]

This class diagram aptly describes the relationships between the various core classes in the UI component.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI elements are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/duke/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

The UI component is exposed to external modules/components via the `Ui` interface. The `UiManager` implements this interface and acts as the manager of the UI component. Hence, `UiManager` holds a reference to the `MainWindow` (the primary UI window that houses the other UI elements that the application will use).

As mentioned, the UI is made up of a `MainWindow` that houses various UI elements such as `CommandWindow`, `HomeWindow`, `PatientWindow`, etc. These UI elements, including `MainWindow` extends from the abstract class `UiElement`. This abstract class serves as the base class for ALL UI elements used in the application, and allows for their easy creation.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Parser Logic
image::plantuml/logic.svg[]

This class diagram describes the relationships between the various core classes involved in parsing the user's input into `Commands`. The first word (delimited by a space or newline) of the user's input is the _command name_. All commands extend the `Command` abstract class, which provides enough functionality for basic commands consisting of a single word. The operation of the `Command` is specified in the `execute` method. The mapping from the command name to the `Command` should be created in the `Commands` class, which is loaded by the default Parser constructor. A Parser can be constructed with subclass of `Commands` to specify a different set of commands.

All commands that have arguments extend `ArgCommand`. Each `ArgCommand` is associated with an `ArgSpec` singleton, whose private constructor sets the parameters of the `ArgCommand`: `emptyArgMsg` (the error message when no argument is supplied), `cmdArgLevel` (an `ArgLevel` enum indicating whether an argument for the command is necessary, optional, or forbidden) and the data structures `switchMap` and `switchAliases`, generated by the `switchInit` function. The `switchInit` function takes a vararg of `Switch` objects, which should specify the switches for the particular `Command`.

`switchMap` maps the full name of a switch to a `Switch` object, describing its properties, and `switchAliases` maps _aliases_ to the full name of the switch they represent. An alias is a string that, when provided by the user as a switch, is recognised as a specific switch. For example, for the switch `investigation` (given as `-i[nv(x|estigation)` in the User Guide) has the following aliases:

* `i`
* `in`
* `inv`
* `invx`
* `inve`
* `inves`
* `invest`
* `investi`
* `investig`
* `investiga`
* `investigat`
* `investigati`
* `investigatio`
* `investigation`

As this would be very tedious to list manually, it is automatically generated by the `switchInit` function, using the data in the `Switch` objects provided to it. Observe that almost all these aliases are prefixes of the word `investigation`, with the shortest being `i`. This follows from the requirement that the switch can be recognised as long as the user has input enough characters for it to be unambiguous. Let `i` in this example be the _root_, the shortest unambiguous part of the full name of the switch. Then, every prefix of the word `investigation` starting from the root is an alias of the switch `investigation`. All these aliases can be generated by a loop in `switchInit`, from the root and the full name in the `Switch` object. Any additional aliases can be supplied via the `aliases` vararg in the `Switch` constructor. Refer to the Javadoc of `Switch` for further details on its fields.

In summary, to define a new `Command`:
* define a subclass of `Command`
* specify its execution in `execute`
* update `Commands` to link the command name to the `Command`

If this is an `ArgCommand`, in addition to doing the above for a subclass of `ArgCommand`:
* define a subclass of `ArgSpec` (by convention, `<name>Spec` is associated with `<name>Command`)
* define the private static field `spec` and the public static `getSpec` to provide singleton behaviour
* create a private constructor for the subclass
** define `cmdArgLevel` and `emptyArgMsg`
** construct the switches for the `ArgCommand` and supply them as arguments to `switchInit`

The Parser class scans through a user supplied string. The first word is extracted, and if the corresponding command is an `ArgCommand`, it uses several nested finite state machines which switch on the characters in the input the scan the rest of the input. Switches are extracted, using the aliases in `switchAliases` to identify the full names of the corresponding switches. The switch arguments are then compared against the requirements of the `ArgCommand`, as stored in the `switchMap`.

The finite state machine for input parsing scans each character for 

[[Design-Model]]
=== Data Model

.Class Diagram
image::ClassDiagram.svg[]

The *_Class Diagram_* shown above describes the relationship among the different data classes used in *Dr. Duke*.

The `statusArr` stores the textual description of each numerical value for the `status`.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage System 
image::ClassDiagramData.png[]

This class diagram describes the relationship between the Storage class, `GsonStorage`, the patient class, `Patient`, and the other classes used to describe and handle patient data. 
 
The storage/load mechanism is facilitated by `GsonStorage`. `GsonStorage` uses the Google-developed Java Library `Gson 2.8.6`. `Gson` is a library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their `JSON` representation. It can also be used to convert `JSON` representations back to the equivalent Java` Object. For more information about `Gson` refer to the `Gson` User Guide at https://github.com/google/gson/blob/master/UserGuide.md. 
 
The `JSON` representations of the patients are stored in a `JSON` file called `patients.json`. 
 
 
`GsonStorage` implements the following operations: 

* `HashMap<String, Patient> loadPatientHashMap()`- Loads all the patients in `patients.json` to the hashmap `patientObservableMap`

* `void writeJsonFile(HashMap<String, Patient> patientMap)`- Creates an array containing the patients in `patientObservableMap` and writes the arrays `JSON` representation to `patients.json`

* `String getFilePath()`- returns the filepath to `patients.json`

* `PatientMap resetAllData()`- Clears `patients.json` and returns an empty hash map

 
When the user boots `Dr.Duke` a `GsonStorage` and a `PatientMap` object is created. The method `loadPatientHashmap` in `GsonStorage` is then executed which extracts all the `JSON` representations of the patients in `patients.json` as a string. The `GSON` method `fromJson()` is then executed on the `JSON` representation of the patients which creates the equivalent java array contaning `Patient` objects. The array is iterated through and every patient is loaded into the `patientObservableMap` attribute of the `PatientMap` object. 
 
During runtime, every new patient that is created is stored in the `patientObservableMap`. 
 
When the user shuts down `Dr.Duke` the `patientObservableMap` is sent back to the `GsonStorage` object by calling the `writeJsonFile` method on the `GsonSotrage` object. The `writeJsonFile` method iterates through the `patientObservableMap` and places every `Patient` object in a java array. When all the patients are in the array the arrays `JSON` representation is created using the `Gson` method `toJson()`. The context of the `patient.son` file is then cleared and the new `JSON` representation of the array containing all the patients is written to the `patient.json` file which concludes the storage circle. 
 
As can be seen in the class diagram, every individual's patient's data in nested from the `Patient` object representing that patient. The diagram also displays that there are no circle references. For these two reasons, using `Gson` to store all the data about the different patients is very convenient and effective as everything can be stored by simply creating the `JSON` representations of each `Patient` object and the rest of the nesting will be parsed automatically by the `Gson` source code. 
 
If further development of `Dr.Duke` requires the storage of other objects that are nested from the patient objects that will be done automatically by the existing storage mechanism as long as there are no circle references. If further development requires storage of objects that are not nested from patient objects the storage mechanism needs to be updated to include two or more arrays instead of one; one containing the `JSON` representations of the `Patient` objects and the other/s containing the `JSON` representation of the other object/s.


== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features in Dr. Duke are implemented.

=== Autocomplete [PANG JIA JUN VERNON]
image:crop_ss.png[]

==== Rationale

Dr. Duke aims to assist House Officers in quick, accurate, and efficient recording and retrieval of patient data required
to provide efficient care. Therefore, one of its main goals is to speed up the process at which users enter their intended
commands so users can get more things done faster. There are several benefits in implementing the autocomplete feature.

* Reduce the time taken for the user to enter a complete and valid command.
* Reduce the frequency at which the user refers to the User Guide or help section to view the syntax of a particular command.

==== Proposed Implementation
The autocomplete mechanism is facilitated by two main classes, namely `AutoCompleteTextField` and `AutoCompleteModel`.

`AutoCompleteTextField` is an element of the UI component. It extends from JavaFX `TextField`, and it displays a contextual
menu whenever the user enters a key character/word in the text field. In our case, a key character/word is defined as such:
a command keyword or switch ("-"). It implements the following operations.

* `AutoCompleteTextField#updateMenu()` - Populates/updates the contextual menu.
* `AutoCompleteTextField#displayMenu()` - Shows the contextual menu.
* `AutoCompleteTextField#hideMenu()` - Hides the contextual menu.

`AutoCompleteModel` is an element of the Model component. It updates the content of the contextual menu as the user
types in the `AutoCompleteTextField`. The content of the contextual menu is also determined by the current context of the application.
 +
 +

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the autocomplete mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application. The `AutoCompleteTextField` in the `CommandWindow` is blank, and the context is `Home`.
The user wishes to add a patient (a sample valid command syntax is `new -name "John Doe" -bed 01 -allergies "paracetamol"`).

Step 2: The user keys in "n" in the text field. At this point, the contextual menu appears and shows the user a list of
available commands in the `Home` context that matches with "n", i.e. `new`.

Step 3: The user then use the arrow keys (up and down) to navigate through the contextual menu and the enter key to
select the appropriate item presented in the menu. The text field is then updated accordingly, and the contextual menu is subsequently hidden.

Step 4: The user proceeds to key in the switches for the `new` command. As the user keys in "-", the contextual menu appears once again
to show the user a list of switches associated with the `new` command, i.e. "-name", "-bed", "-allergies", etc.

Step 5: The user will repeat Steps 3 and 4 until a valid command syntax has been fully entered. The user will then press
the enter key to execute said command.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user types in the `AutoCompleteTextField`.

==== Alternatives

* Typeahead
** Pros: More intuitive to the end-users.
** Cons: Significantly more complex to implement.

== Features

=== Switch Autocorrect

If a user-supplied switch is _not_ an alias for any switch, this triggers the disambiguation functions in `CommandHelpers`. We use a modified Levnshtein-Damerau distance which takes into account distance on a standard QWERTY keyboard in weighting the cost of substitutions and transpositions (pseudocode from https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1963190.1963191[here] and ideas for implementation of keyboard distance analysis from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29233888/[here]). The distance of the ambiguous string to every alias is calculated, with basic pruning implemented, terminating the distance estimation computation if it exceeds the minimum distance found so far.

If there is a switch with a unique lowest distance from the input string, that switch is automatically selected. If not, the user is prompted with a screen listing the closest matches, as well as all valid switches for this command. The closest matches are numbered, and the user may select one by entering its corresponding number, or he may enter another valid switch in its full form.

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

*House officers*, who are typically freshly-graduated medical students, play a vital role in managing hospital patients.
They are responsible, among many other things, for collating all information regarding each hospital patient and
organising it to provide a clear picture of the patient's situation, and for presenting that picture to senior doctors
who can then make assessments and recommendations based on that picture. As much of this information needs to be
exchanged at a rapid pace, *Dr. Duke* assists in quick, accurate and efficient recording and retrieval of the patient
data required to provide effective care.

The house officers we are targeting with this app:

* need to manage a significant number of patients
* need to quickly input and organise patient data
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* prefer typing over mouse input
* can type fast

*Value proposition*:

* input, organise and access information about patients faster than with a typical mouse/GUI driven app
