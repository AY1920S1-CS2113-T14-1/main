== Introduction

*Dr. Duke* is a GUI-based personal assistant for doctors to manage their patients' data.

It provides house officers with a streamlined notebook environment, which allows them to concentrate on quickly and accurately recording patient data in a standard format.
If you're a house officer who types fast and don't mind learning how to use a keyboard-based application to type faster, then this application is for you!

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

* *JDK 11* or above (get the latest version of Java https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[here])

=== Getting Started

. Download the latest `.jar` release file from our https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113-T14-1/main/releases[release page].
. Move the `.jar` file to the folder which you want to use as *Dr. Duke*'s home.
. Double click on the `.jar` file.

*Dr. Duke* should open shortly.

== Terminology

* This app manages multiple `Patients`.
Each Patient has one or more `Impressions` (diagnoses), and each Impression is supported by `Evidences` and treated by `Treatments`.
** `Evidences` consist of: [[evidences]]
*** `Observations`: symptoms observed or reported by the patient
*** `Results`: the results of investigations performed
** `Treatments` consist of: [[treatments]]
*** `Investigations`: medical procedures such as scans or blood tests intended to find out more about the patient's condition
*** `Medicine`: a course of medicine prescribed to the patient
*** `Plans`: miscellaneous treatment plans (e.g. encourage patient to walk)
* The different screens you can view in the application are referred to as `Contexts`. [[contexts]]
Each context is associated with a particular set of data (e.g. the Patient context shows a detailed view of a particular Patient), and has its own set of commands.
* `priority` refers to how critical a Treatment or Evidence is. *0* means not urgent, excluding the item from the criticality system, *1* means critical.
The other values are not defined specifically but the greater they are, the lower the priority.
These lower priority levels are meant to remain flexible for the user to provide his own desired level of fine-graining and task management.
** [[priority-1]] `priority` *1* generally refers to something that needs to be followed up on or investigated immediately, e.g. signs of severe complications. `priority` *1* items will be displayed prominently to remind the house officer to respond to it when treating the patient.
* `status` refers to the stage of completion of a Treatment. `<status name>` refers to the textual description for each stage of completion.

== Commands [[commands]]

Each command consists of a _name_, an _argument_ (information supplied to a command to tell it where or how to act), and some number of _switches_ (settings for a command that modify its behavior). Switches can also have arguments.

For example, `discharge "John Doe" *-sum* "John Doe was discharged on 9 October 2019 at 3:54 pm".` represents the command `discharge` with the argument `"John Doe"`, modified by the switch `*-sum*` (meaning "summary"), which has the switch argument `"John Doe was discharged on 9 October 2019 at 3:54 pm."`.

Only a few characters have a special meaning when you are giving *Dr. Duke* commands.
These are `\`, `-`, `<Space>`/`<Newline>`, and `<Enter>`:

* `\` -> Escape character: the special character after a backslash loses its special meaning.
To type a literal backslash, you need to escape the backslash: `Hello\\World` becomes `Hello\World`.
* `-` -> Indicates the start of a switch.
Must immediately be followed by an argument, if the switch requries one.
* `<Space>`/`<Newline>` -> A switch is separated from its argument by a space or a newline.
* `<Enter>` -> This sends a command to Dr. Duke. `<Shift-Enter>` would insert a new line.
* `<Page Up>` and `<Page Down>` -> Access the input history.

The documentation below uses the following notation to describe the structure of the commands recognised:

* `<>` -> input of the type specified
* `[]` -> optional element of a command
* `(a | b | c)` -> input that can be one of several possible options, in this case `a`, `b`, or `c`
* `"<>"` -> string, must be surrounded by quotes
* `[]*` -> 0 or more copies of the contents of `[]`, separated by spaces

The following italicised words refer to specific repeated patterns:

* _patient_id_ -> `(<patient's index in list> | "<search string>" | *-b[ed]* "<bed number>")` [[patient_id]]
* _string_or_idx_ -> `(<index> | "<search string>")` [[string_or_idx]]
** `<index>` refers to the numerical position assigned to the object in the displayed list.
** A `<search string>` will be searched for in the names of all relevant objects.

Parsing rules:

* If a `"<search string>"` is given, the user will be presented with a window of search results that have names matching the search string (ignoring case), if the object to which it is referring is ambiguous. Refer to <<home-open, the `open` command in the Home context>> for a concrete example. Within the search result window, the user may enter the index of an object to select it.
* Switches can be in any order.
* Switches with optional parts of their names can be recognised with any portion of the optional part. E.g. `-crit` matches `-c[ritical]`.
* If it is ambiguous whether an argument is for the command itself, or one of the switches, it will be presumed to belong to the switch.

=== Home [[home]]

.Home
image::home.png[Home]

Displays up to *100* indexed panels of `Patients`.
Each panel provides the user with a *summary* of the main details of a particular `Patient`.
They are as follows.

. Name
. Bed number (key identifier of a `Patient`)
. Primary diagnosis
. <<priority-1, Number of critical issues>>

==== `new` - Add a new Patient [[home-new]]

Format: `new *-n[ame]* "<name>" *-b[ed]* "<bed number>" *-a[llerg(y | ies)]* "<allergies>" *[<optional switch>]**` +

Optional switches*:

* `*-g[o]*`
* `*-h[eight]* <height>` (expressed in cm)
* `*-w[eight]* <weight>` (expressed in kg)
* `*-ag[e]* <age>`
* `*-num[ber]* <number>`
* `*-ad[dress]* "<address>"`
* `*-hi[story]* "<history>"`

The Patient's name, bed number and allergies must be specified. Allergies should be expressed in comma-separated values (CSV) format.
The other optional fields are set to undefined values by default.
The `*-g[o]*` switch opens the <<Patient, Patient's context>> for the newly added Patient.

**Example**
****
*new* `*-n*` "John Doe" `*-b*` "A103" `*-a*` "paracetamol, cinnarizine, warfarin" `*-h*` 175 `*-w*` 60 `*-ag*` 35 `*-hi*` "Heart attack 3 years ago"
****

==== `open` - Go to a more detailed view of a particular Patient [[home-open]]

Format: `open <<patient_id, _patient_id_>> *[-im[pression]]*`

If opening by _<search string>_, Patients will be searched through by *name*, and results presented and selected as per the <<home-find, `find`>> command. For example, if the user manages three Patients named "John", "Jack" and "Joe", `open jo` will open a search result context with "John" and "Joe" but not "Jack", even if "Jack" has, e.g. an address of "42 Joy Street" (because his name does not contain "jo").

If the optional `*-im[pression]*` switch is provided, access the <<Impression, primary diagnosis>> for that particular Patient.

**Example**
****
*open* 1 `*-impress*`   (This command opens the first Patient in the list and goes to his primary Impression) +
*open* `*-b*` "C210"    (This command opens the Patient with the specified bed number) +
*open* "Duke"   (This command searches for a Patient named "Duke" and opens his context, or displays all Patients with "duke" in their names if there is more than one)
****

==== `find` - Find items matching certain criteria [[home-find]]

Format: `find ["<search string>"] [_type_]` +
`[_type_]` -> (`*-p[atient]*` | `*-im[pression]*` | `*-e[vidence]*` | `*-t[reatment]*`)

Display a list of all Patients, Impressions, Treatments, and Evidences matching the criteria specified in the search.
If none of the `_type_` switches are used, all types of objects listed above will be shown.
If at least one of them is listed, only objects whose type is used as a switch will be listed.

**Example**
****
*find* "cough"    (This command searches for Patients only) +
*find* "John" `*-p*`    (This command searches for Patients only) +
*find* "aspirin" `*-im*` `*-t*` (This command searches for Impressions and Treatments)
****

==== `report` - Generate a detailed report for the Patient [[home-report]]

Format: `report <<patient_id, _patient_id_>>`

The report contains all of the information being tracked regarding the Patient.

**Example**
****
*report* 2 +
*report* "John Doe"
****

==== `discharge` - Generate a discharge report for the Patient and delete him/her from the system [[home-discharge]]

Format: `discharge <<patient_id, _patient_id_>> [*-sum[mary]* "<discharge summary>"]`

The discharge report contains all of the information being tracked regarding the Patient.
An optional discharge summary may be specified in the command to add additional information.
In *v2.0*, they will be <<home-archive, archived>>.

**Example**
****
*discharge* 5 `*-summary*` "Patient will return again on 02/11/2019 for final consultation"`
****

==== `undo` - Undo the previous command [*v2.0*] [[home-undo]]

Format: `undo <number of commands>`

_Available in:_ <<Home>>, <<Patient>>, <<Impression>>, <<Treatment and Evidence>>

You may undo up to the last 10 commands.
Only commands that affect the state of the system count against this limit (e.g. adding new Patients or editing data, not navigating across contexts).

==== `redo` - Redo a command that has been undone [*v2.0*] [[home-redo]]

Format: `redo <number of commands>`

_Available in:_ <<Home>>, <<Patient>>, <<Impression>>, <<Treatment and Evidence>>

After an <<home-undo, undo>> command is executed, any commands (other than `undo` or `redo`) sent will clear the `redo` stack.
The undone commands cannot be redone from that point onwards.

==== `critical` - Display all critical Tvidence and Treatments of all Patients [*v2.0*]

Format: `critical`

==== `archive` - Display all discharged patients [[home-archive]] [*v2.0*]

Format: `archive`

=== Patient [[patient]]

.Patient
image::Patient.PNG[Patient]

Shows a detailed view of a `Patient`. The details are displayed in separate panels as seen in the figure above.

* Personal details such as name, age, height, weight, etc.
* List of allergies
* Medical history

and the number of critical items associated with the Impression)
* List of critical <<Treatments, `Treatments`>> and <<Evidences, `Evidences`>> (of <<priority-1, priority 1>>)
* List of _follow-up_ items, which are items that are not completed and that the user will need to follow up on. These consist of:
** `Plan` items with status less than 2 (a status of 2 indicates completion)
** `Investigation` items (once completed, an investigation would be converted to a result)
** There may be items *duplicated* across the critical and follow-up lists as it is meant to give a view of two different but possibly overlapping categories of items that the user might want to view at a glance.

Inherits: <<home-undo,`undo`>>, <<home-redo,`redo`>>

==== `new` - Add a new Impression for this Patient

Format: `new *-n[ame]* "<name>" *-desc[ription]* "<description>" [*-g[o]*]` +

|===

`<status name>` is the name of a status that the user wishes to set (case is ignored), and `<status idx>` is a numerical representation. Note that both `priority idx` and `status idx` are expected to be non-negative integers.

**Example**
****
*new* `*-m*` `*-name*` "Penicillin" `*-dose*` "Twice daily after meal" `*-duration*` "1 week" +
*new* `*-ob*` `*-name*` "Complaints of pain in chest" `*-subj*` +
*new* `*-inv*` `*-name*` "Blood test"
****

==== `open` - Open a Treatment or Evidence item listed on this page

Format: `open ("<search string>" | *-e[vidence]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>> | *-t[reatment]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>>)`

This will open a new context for the specific Treatment or Evidence identified. If a _<search string>_ is used, items will be searched through by *name*, and results presented and selected as per the <<impression-open, `open`>> command,

**Example**
****
*open* `*-t*` 3 (This command opens the third Treatment in the Treatment list) +
*open* `*-e*` "pneumonia" (This command opens an Evidence that contains the word "pneumonia", or a search window if there are multiple such items) +
*open* "blood" (This command opens a Treatment or Evidence that contains the word "blood", or a search window if there are multiple such items)
****

==== `edit` - Edit one of the details of the Impression, or one of its Treatment or Evidence items

Format: `edit *[-app[end]]* ( "<search string>" | *-e[vidence]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>> | *-t[reatment]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>> | *-im[pression]* ) <switch> [<new value>] [<switch> [<new value>]]*`

If input with the `-im[pression]` switch set, it edits the Impression itself. The switches and corresponding new value formats are as follows:

* `*-n[ame]* "<name>"`
* `*-desc[ription]* "<description>"`

Otherwise, it edits the Treatment or Evidence specified, following the <<impression-open, selection rules for `open`>>. The possible values for `<switch>` and `<new value>` can be found in the associated <<type-table,table>>.

If `*-app*` is selected, the `<new value>` of *ALL* string-valued fields will be appended to their current values.

**Example**
****
*edit* `*-im*` `*-name*` "Malaria" `*-desc*` "High fever. Complaints of blurred vision." +
*edit* `*-e*` 1 `*-sta*` 1 +
*edit* `*-t*` "Theophylline" `*-dose*` "As and when required." `*-app*`
****

==== `delete` - Delete a Treatment or Evidence item listed on this page

Format: `delete ("<search string>" | *-e[vidence]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>>  | *-t[reatment]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>> )`

Deletes a Treatment or Evidence. The same <<impression-open, selection rules for `open`>> apply here.

**Example**
****
*delete* `*-t*` 3 +
*delete* `*-e*` "pneumonia" +
*delete* "blood" 
****

==== `primary` - Set this Impression as the primary Impression for the Patient

Format: `primary`

==== `move` - Move a Treatment or Evidence to a different Impression

Format: `move ("<search string>" | *-e[vidence]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>> | *-t[reatment]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>>) [*-im[pression]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>>]`

If a Treatment or Evidence is assigned incorrectly, it can be moved to a different Impression via this command.
If the `-im[pression]` switch is not used to specify the Impression to move it to, a window listing all Impressions will first appear, and the user can select the correct Impression using its list index.

**Example**
****
*move* `*-t*` "aspirin" `*-im*` "Dengue Fever" (moves the Treatment called "aspirin" to the Impression called "dengue fever", opening a search window for each if ambiguous) +
*move* `*-e*` "pneumonia" (opens a search window listing all the Impressions of this Patient, aside from the current one, and allows the user to select which one to move the Evidence containing "pneumonia" in its name to, opening another search window is necessary) +
****

==== `priority` - Mark a Treatment or Evidence as a certain priority level

Format: `priority ("<search string>" | *-e[vidence]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>> | *-t[reatment]* <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>>) *-s[et]* <new priority>`

**Example**
****
*priority* `*-t*` 1 `*-set*` 1  (This command sets priority of a Treatment by index) +
*priority* `*-e*` "pneumonia" `*-set*` 2  (This command sets priority of an Evidence by search string) +
*priority* "blood test" `*-set*` 2  (This command sets priority by index)
****

==== `status` - Update the completion status of a Treatment

Format: `status <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>> [*-s[et]* ("<status name>" | <status idx>)]`

If `-s[et]` is not specified, `status` will be incremented by 1, unless it is at the maximum value. The same <<patient-open, rules for `open`>> apply here.

**Example**
****
*status* "paracetamol" `*-set*` 2 +
*status* "tylenol"
****

==== `result` - Convert an Investigation that has been completed into a Result

Format: `result <<_string_or_idx_, string_or_idx>> *-sum[mary]* "<result summary>"`

_idx_ in this scope will refer to an index in the Treatment list. The result summary will be appended to the Investigation summary.

**Example**
****
*result* "blood test" `*-summary*` "High white blood cells count" +
****

==== `find` - Find items matching certain criteria [[impression-find]]

Format: `find ["<search string>"] [_type_]` +
`[_type_]` -> (`*-e[vidence]*` | `*-t[reatment]*`) +

Display a list of all Treatments and Evidences matching the criteria specified in the search. If none of the `_type_` switches are used, all types of objects will be listed. If at least one of them is listed, only objects whose type is used as a switch will be listed.

**Example**
****
*find* "aspirin" `*-treatment*` (This command searches for Treatments) +
*find* "blood" `*-evidence*` (This command searches for Evidences) +
*find* "high" (This command searches for Treatments AND Evidences)
****

.Example of a Treatment (Medicine) context
image::Medicine.PNG[Medicine]

=== Treatment and Evidence

All <<Treatment, Treatment>> (Medicine, Investigation, Plan) and <<Evidence, Evidence>> (Observation and Result) contexts (one for each type of Treatment and each type of Evidence) behave in essentially the same way: they display all their data in full.
This section will list the commands that they have in common.
Each individual Treatment and Evidence context is assumed to have all these commands, and all the commands in this inheritance list.

Inherits: <<patient-back,`back`>>, <<patient-up,`up`>>, <<home-undo,`undo`>>, <<home-redo,`redo`>>

==== `edit` - Edit one of the details of the Treatment or Evidence

Format: `edit [-app[end]] <switch> [<new value>] [<switch> [<new value>]]*`

**Example**
****
*edit* `*-dose*` "Thrice daily; before meals" (This command is applied in the `Medicine` context) +
*edit* `*-summary*` "Inconclusive findings; need more tests" (This command is applied in the `Investigation` context) +
****

The possible values for `<switch>` and `<new value>` can now be found in this <<type-table,table>>.

==== `move` - Move a Treatment or Evidence to a different Impression [*v2.0*]

Format: `move [-im[pression] "<search string>"]`

If a Treatment or Evidence is assigned incorrectly, it can be moved to a different Impression via this command.
If the `-im[pression]` switch is not used to specify the Impression to move it to, a window listing all Impressions will appear, and the user can select the correct Impression using its list index.

==== `priority` - Mark the Treatment or Evidence as a certain priority level [*v2.0*]

Format: `priority <new priority>`

`<new priority>` must be a non-negative integer.

=== Treatment [*v2.0*]
