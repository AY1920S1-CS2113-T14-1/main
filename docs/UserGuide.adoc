== Introduction

*Dr. Duke* is a command-line based personal assistant for doctors to manage their patients' data.

It provides house officers with a streamlined notebook environment, which allows them to concentrate on quickly and accurately recording patient data in a standard format.
If you're a house officer who types fast and doesn't mind learning how to use a keyboard-based app to type faster, then this application is for you!

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

* *JDK 11* or above (get the latest version of Java https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[here]!)

=== Getting Started

. Download the latest `.jar` release file from our https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113-T14-1/main/releases[release page].
. Move the `.jar` file to the folder which you want to use as *Dr. Duke*'s home.
. Double click on the `.jar` file.

*Dr. Duke* should open shortly.

.UI

== Usage

* This app manages multiple Patients.
Each Patient has one or more Impressions (diagnoses), and each Impression is supported by Evidence and treated by Treatments.
Evidence consists of Observations and Results.
Treatments consist of Plans, Investigations and Medicine.
* The different screens you can view are referred to as contexts.
Each context is associated with a particular set of data to display, and has its own set of commands.
* `priority` refers to how critical a Treatment or Evidence is. 0 means not urgent, excluding the item from the criticality system, 1 means critical.
The other values are not defined specifically but the greater they are, the lower the priority.
These lower priority levels are meant to remain flexible for the user to provide his desired level of fine-graining and task management.
** `priority` 1 generally refers to something that needs to be followed up on or investigated immediately, e.g. signs of severe complications. `priority` 1 items will be displayed prominently to remind the user to respond to it when treating the patient.
* `status` refers to the stage of completion of a Treatment. `<status name>` refers to the textual description for each stage of completion.

= Specifying Commands

Commands consist of a command name, an argument, and some number of swtiches: settings for a command that modify its behavior.
Switches can also have arguments.

For example, `discharge John Doe -sum John Doe was discharged on 9 October 2019 at 3:54 pm.` represents the command `discharge` with the argument `John Doe`, modified by the switch `-sum` (meaning "summary"), which has the switch argument `John Doe was discharged on 9 October 2019 at 3:54 pm.`.

Only a few characters have a special meaning when you are giving Dr. Duke commands.
These are `\`, `-`, `<Space>`/`<Newline>`, and `<Enter>`:

* `\` -> Escape character: the special character after a backslash loses its special meaning.
To type a literal backslash, you need to escape the backslash: `Hello\\World` becomes `Hello\World`.
* `-` -> Indicates the start of a switch.
Must immediately be followed by an argument, if the switch requries one.
* `<Space>`/`<Newline>` -> A switch is separated from its argument by a space or a newline.
* `<Enter>` -> This sends a command to Dr. Duke. `<Shift-Enter>` would insert a new line.

The documentation below uses the following notation to describe the structure of the commands recognised:

* `[]` -> optional element of a command
* `<>` -> input of the type specified
* `(a | b | c)` -> input that can be one of several possible options, in this case `a`, `b` or `c`
* `"<>"` -> string, must be surrounded by quotes if it contains a space (or escape the space with a backslash)
* `[]*` -> 0 or more copies of the contents of `[]`, separated by spaces

The following italicised words refer to specific repeated patterns:

* _patient_id_ -> `(<patient's index> | <part of name> | *-b[ed]* <bed number>)`
* _string_or_idx_ -> `(<index> | "<search string>")`
** `<index>` refers to the index assigned to the object in the display. `<search string>` will be searched for in the names of all relevant objects.
* _type_ -> (`-m[edicine]` | `-in[v(x | estigation)]` | `-p[lan]` | `-o[bservation]` | `-r[esult]`)

Parsing rules:

* Switches can be in any order
* Switches with optional parts of their names can be recognised with any portion of the optional part. E.g. `-crit` matches `-c[ritical]`.
* If it is ambiguous whether an argument is for the command itself, or one of the switches, it will be presumed to belong to the switch.

== Contexts

The subsections below describe the available commands in each context.

=== Home [[home]]

Displays up to *150* indexed panels of `Patients`.
Each panel provides the user with a summary of the main details of a particular `Patient`.
They are as follows.

. Name
. Bed number
. Primary diagnosis
. Number of critical issues

==== `help` - Display a context-specific list of commands and options [[home-help]]

Format: `help`

_Available in:_ <<Home>>, <<Patient>>, <<Impression>>, <<Treatment and Evidence>>

This command is available in every context.
It functions essentially the same way, just with different commands.

==== `new` - Add a new Patient to the system

Format: `new *-n[ame]* "<name>" *-b[ed]* <bed number> *-a[llerg(y | ies)]* "<allergies>" *[<optional switch>]**`

Optional switches:

* `*-g[o]*`
* `*-h[eight]* <height>`
* `*-w[eight]* <weight>`
* `*-ag[e]* <age>`
* `*-num[ber]* <number>`
* `*-ad[dress]* "<address>"`
* `*-hi[story]* "<history>"`

The patient's name, bed number and allergies must be specified.
The other optional fields are set to undefined values by default.
The `*-g[o]*` switch opens the <<Patient, Patient>>'s context for the newly added patient.

==== `open` - Go to a more detailed view of a particular Patient

Format: `open _patient_id_ *[-im[pression]]*`

If the optional `*-im[pression]*` switch is provided, access the <<impression, primary impression>> for that particular Patient.

// TODO: Complete documentation
==== `find`

==== `history` - Add miscellaneous notes to a patient's history [[home-history]]

Format: `history _patient_id_ *-m[essage]* "<notes>" *[-r[ewrite]]*`

Quickly append notes to a patient's history.
If the optional `*-r[ewrite]*` command is provided, the patient's history will be rewritten instead.
This command is meant for quickly jotting down un-categorised information.
It is not for correcting serious mistakes that need the patient's entire history section to be written.

==== `discharge` - Generate a discharge report for the patient and delete him/her from the system [[home-discharge]]

Format: `discharge _patient_id_ *[-sum[mary]]* "<discharge summary>"]`

The discharge report contains all of the information being tracked regarding the Patient.
An optional discharge summary may be specified in the command to add additional information.
In v2.0, they will be <<home-archive, archived>>.

==== `undo` - Undo the previous command [v1.4] [[home-undo]]

Format: `undo <number of commands>`

_Available in:_ <<Home>>, <<Patient>>, <<Impression>>, <<Treatment and Evidence>>

You may undo up to the last 10 commands.
Only commands that affect the state of the system count against this limit (e.g. adding new Patients or editing data, not navigating across contexts).

==== `redo` - Redo a command that has been undone [v1.4] [[home-redo]]

Format: `redo <number of commands>`

_Available in:_ <<Home>>, <<Patient>>, <<Impression>>, <<Treatment and Evidence>>

After an <<home-undo, undo>> command is executed, any commands (other than `undo` or `redo`) sent will clear the `redo` stack.
The undone commands cannot be redone from that point onwards.

==== `critical` - Display all critical observations and plans of all patients [v2.0]

Format: `critical`

==== `archive` - Display all discharged patients [[home-archive]] [v2.0]

Format: `archive`

=== Patient [[patient]]

Shows a detailed view of a `Patient`. The details are displayed in separate panels as follows.

* Personal details such as name, age, height, weight, etc.
* List of allergies
* Medical history
* List of `Impressions` with their associated details (the name, an excerpt of its description,
  and the number of critical items and follow-up investigations associated with it)
* List of critical `Treatments` and `Evidences` (of `priority` 1)
* List of `Investigations` to follow up on (i.e. all current investigations; completed investigations should be stored as `Results`)

Inherits: <<home-help,`help`>>, <<home-undo,`undo`>>, <<home-redo,`redo`>>

==== `new` - Add a new Impression for this Patient

Format: `new *-n[ame]* "<name>" *-desc[ription]* "<description>" *[-g[o]]*`

Opens the new <<Impression, Impression>>'s context if `-g[o]` is specified.

==== `open` - Open a critical (`Treatment` / `Evidence`) or `Investigation` item listed on the page, or an `Impression`

Format: `open ("<search string>" | *-c[ritical]* _string_or_idx_ | *-i[nv(x|estigation)]* _string_or_idx_ | *-im[pression]* _string_or_idx_)`

==== `edit` - Edit one of the details of the Patient [[patient-edit]]

Format: `edit <switch> [<new value>] [<switch> [<new value>]]* *[-app[end]]*`

For string-valued fields, `-app` will append the field's `<new value>` to its current value.

Switches and corresponding new value format:

// TODO: Changes need to be made to Patient class.
//* `*-n[ame]* "<name>"`
//* `*-b[ed]* <bed number>`
* `*-h[eight]* <height>`
* `*-w[eight]* <weight>`
* `*-ag[e]* <age>`
* `*-num[ber]* <number>`
* `*-ad[dress]* "<address>"`
* `*-hi[story]* "<history>"`
* `*-a[llerg(y | ies)]* "<allergies>"`

In v1.4, if a `<new value>` is not supplied, a text box with the current value loaded inside will be displayed for the user to edit.

==== `delete` - Delete a critical (`Treatment` / `Evidence`) or `Investigation` item listed on the page, or an `Impression`

Format: `delete ("<search string>" | *-c[ritical]* _string_or_idx_ | *-i[nv(x|estigation)]* _string_or_idx_ | *-im[pression]* _string_or_idx_)`

==== `history` - Append miscellaneous notes to a patient's medical history

Format: `history <additional notes>`

Format: `find ["<search string>"][-im[pressions]] [_type_]* [-pri[ority] <priority>] [-sta[tus] ("<status name>" | <status idx>)]`

Display a list of all Impressions, Treatments and Evidence matching the criteria specified in the search.
If none of the `_type_` or `im[pression]` switches are used, all types of objects will be listed.
If at least one of them is listed, only objects whose type is used as a switch will be listed.

==== `discharge` - Generate a discharge report for the Patient and delete him/her from the system

Format: `discharge *[-sum[mary]* <discharge summary>]`

Functionally the same as <<home-discharge,`discharge` in the Home context>>.

==== `report` - Generate a text file containing all data on this patient [[patient-report]]

Format: `report`

A report will be generated in the format required by the hospital's internal systems.
In v2.0, the hospital's required format can be specified.

_Available in:_ <<Patient>>, <<Impression>>, <<Treatment and Evidence>>

==== `back` - Go back to the previous context [[patient-back]]

Format: `back`

_Available in:_ <<Patient>>, <<Impression>>, <<Treatment and Evidence>>

This will go back to the immediate context that the user came from.
A context stack will be maintained.

==== `up` - Go up to the next-higher context [[patient-up]]

_Available in:_ <<Patient>>, <<Impression>>, <<Treatment and Evidence>>

This will go to the context hierarchically above the user's context.
In the <<Patient, Patient>> context, it will go back to <<Home, Home>> context.
In the <<Impression, Impression>> context, it will go back to the <<Patient, Patient>> context associated with it.

==== `round` - Ward round mode [v2.0]

Format: `round`

_Available in:_ <<Patient>>, <<Impression>>, <<Treatment and Evidence>> [v2.0]

An input mode designed for maximum speed input.
Only the first word of the input, which should be a sequence of control characters, will determine where the input is directed.
Everything else will be treated as input.

=== Impression [[impression]]

Shows a detailed view of an Impression, displaying in separate panels:

* The name and full description of the Impression
* A list of Evidence for the Impression, sorted by default with critical items first
* A list of Treatments for the Impression, sorted by default with critical items first, followed by investigations that require follow-up
* A small panel with the patient's allergies

Inherits: <<home-help,`help`>>, <<patient-back,`back`>>, <<patient-up,`up`>>, <<patient-report,`report`>>, <<home-undo,`undo`>>, <<home-redo,`redo`>>

|===

`<status name>` is a case-insensitive substring of the `statusArr` entry of that particular object, while `<status idx>` is its numerical representation.

==== `open` - Open a Treatment or Evidence item listed on this page

Format: `open ("<search string>" | -e[vidence] _string_or_idx_ | -t[reatment] _string_or_idx_)`

This will open a new context for the specific Treatment or Evidence identified.

==== `edit` - Edit one of the details of the Impression

Format: `edit [-app[end]] [_type_ _string_or_idx_] <switch> [<new value>] [<switch> [<new value>]]`

If input without `_type_ _string_or_idx_`, the switches and corresponding new value formats are as follows:

* `-n[ame] "<name>"`
* `-desc[ription] "<description>"`

With an additional type switch, the command instead edits an associated Treatment or Evidence.
The possible values for `<switch>` and `<new value>` can be found in the associated <<type-table,table>> for `new`.

==== `delete` - Delete a Treatment or Evidence item listed on this page

Format: `delete ("<search string>" | -e[vidence] _string_or_idx_ | -t[reatment] _string_or_idx_)`

==== `primary` - Set this Impression as the primary Impression for the Patient

Format: `primary`

==== `move` - Move a Treatment or Evidence to a different Impression

Format: `move ("<search string>" | -e[vidence] _string_or_idx_ | -t[reatment] _string_or_idx_) [-im[pression] "<search string>"]`

If a Treatment or Evidence is assigned incorrectly, it can be moved to a different Impression via this command.
If the `-im[pression]` switch is not used to specify the Impression to move it to, a window listing all Impressions will appear, and the user can select the correct Impression using its list index.

==== `priority` - Mark a Treatment or Evidence as a certain priority level

Format: `priority ("<search string>" | -e[vidence] _string_or_idx_ | -t[reatment] _string_or_idx_) -s <new priority>`

`<new priority>` must be a non-negative integer.

==== `status` - Update the completion status of a Treatment

Format: `status _string_or_idx_ [-s ("<status name>" | <status idx>)]`

If `-s` is not specified, `status` will be incremented by 1, unless it is at the maximum value.

==== `result` - Convert an Investigation that has been completed into a Result

Format: `result _string_or_idx_ -sum[mary] "<result summary>"`

_idx_ in this scope will refer to an index in the Treatment list.
The result summary will be appended to the Investigation summary.

==== `find` - Find items matching certain criteria

Format: `find ["<search string>"] [_type_]* [-pri[ority] <priority>] [-sta[tus] ("<status name>" | <status idx>)]`

Display a list of all Treatments and Evidence matching the criteria specified in the search.
If none of the `_type_` switches are used, all types of objects will be listed.
If at least one of them is listed, only objects whose type is used as a switch will be listed.

=== Treatment and Evidence

All Treatment and Evidence contexts (one for each type of Treatment and each type of Evidence) behave in essentially the same way: they display all their data in full.
This section will list the commands that they have in common.
Each individual Treatment and Evidence context is assumed to have all these commands, and all the commands in this inheritance list.

Inherits: <<home-help,`help`>>, <<patient-back,`back`>>, <<patient-up,`up`>>, <<patient-report,`report`>>, <<home-undo,`undo`>>, <<home-redo,`redo`>>

==== `edit` - Edit one of the details of the Treatment or Evidence

Format: `edit [-app[end]] <switch> [<new value>] [<switch> [<new value>]]`

The possible values for `<switch>` and `<new value>` can now be found in the <<type-table,table>> for `new` in the Impression context.

==== `move` - Move a Treatment or Evidence to a different Impression

Format: `move [-im[pression] "<search string>"]`

If a Treatment or Evidence is assigned incorrectly, it can be moved to a different Impression via this command.
If the `-im[pression]` switch is not used to specify the Impression to move it to, a window listing all Impressions will appear, and the user can select the correct Impression using its list index.

==== `priority` - Mark the Treatment or Evidence as a certain priority level

Format: `priority <new priority>`

`<new priority>` must be a non-negative integer.

=== Treatment

Contains everything in <<Treatment and Evidence>>.

==== `status` - Update the completion status of a Treatment

Format: `status [("<status name>" | <status idx>)]`

If no `<status name>` or `<status idx>` is specified, `status` will be incremented by 1, unless it is at the maximum value.

=== Investigation

Contains everything in <<Treatment and Evidence>>.

==== `result` - Convert the Investigation into a Result after completion

Format: `result -sum[mary] "<result summary>"`

The result summary will be appended to the Investigation summary.

== FAQ

*Q*: How can I continue working with the same data on a different computer? +
*A*: Install this application on the other computer.
All of your *Dr. Duke* data is stored persistently in the `data`
folder, and can be transferred without any configuration to the `data` folder of the new installation.
