[[Design-Logic]]
=== Parser Logic [JOHN CUTHBERT KHOO TENG FONG]
image::plantuml/logic.svg[]

This class diagram describes the relationships between the various core classes involved in parsing the user's input into `Commands`. The first word (delimited by a space or newline) of the user's input is the _command name_. All commands extend the `Command` abstract class, which provides enough functionality for basic commands consisting of a single word. The operation of the `Command` is specified in the `execute` method. The mapping from the command name to the `Command` should be created in the `Commands` class, which is loaded by the default `Parser` constructor, together with a reference to a `Context` enum (ordinarily, a reference to the `context` field in the `DukeCore` instance). A `Parser` can also be constructed with a subclass of `Commands` to specify a different set of commands.

The `Commands` class has a single function `getCommand()`, which takes, as arguments, a String that should uniquely identify the requested `Command` within a particular `Context`, and a `Context` enum representing the context from which the `Command` was called. It constructs and returns a new instance of the `Command` object thus identified.

==== Commands

If a `Command` has no arguments, the newly constructed instance is returned without further processing. If it takes any arguments, it extends `ArgCommand`. Each `ArgCommand` is associated with an `ArgSpec` singleton, whose private constructor sets the parameters of the `ArgCommand`: `emptyArgMsg` (the error message when no argument is supplied), `cmdArgLevel` (an `ArgLevel` enum indicating whether an argument for the command is necessary, optional, or forbidden) and the data structures `switchMap` and `switchAliases`, generated by the `switchInit()` function. The `switchInit()` function takes a vararg of `Switch` objects, which should specify the switches for the particular `Command`.

`switchMap` maps the full name of a switch to a `Switch` object, describing its properties, and `switchAliases` maps _aliases_ to the full name of the switch they represent. An alias is a string that, when provided by the user as a switch, is recognised as a specific switch. For example, for the switch `investigation` (given as `-i[nv(x|estigation)]` in the User Guide) has the following aliases:

* `i`
* `in`
* `inv`
* `invx`
* `inve`
* `inves`
* `invest`
* `investi`
* `investig`
* `investiga`
* `investigat`
* `investigati`
* `investigatio`
* `investigation`

As this would be very tedious to list manually, it is automatically generated by the `switchInit()` function, using the data in the `Switch` objects provided to it. Observe that almost all these aliases are prefixes of the word `investigation`, with the shortest being `i`. This follows from the requirement that the switch can be recognised as long as the user has input enough characters for it to be unambiguous. Let `i` in this example be the _root_, the shortest unambiguous part of the full name of the switch. Then, every prefix of the word `investigation` starting from the root is an alias of the switch `investigation`. All aliases of this form are generated by a loop in `switchInit()`, from the root and the full name in the `Switch` object. Any additional aliases can be supplied via the `aliases` vararg in the `Switch` constructor. Refer to the Javadoc of `Switch` for further details on its fields.

In summary, to define a new `Command`:

. Define a subclass of `Command`
. Specify its execution in `execute`
. Update `Commands` to link the command name to the `Command`

If this is an `ArgCommand`, in addition to doing the above for a subclass of `ArgCommand`:

. Define a subclass of `ArgSpec` (by convention, `<name>Spec` is associated with `<name>Command`)
. Define the private static field `spec` and the public static method `getSpec()` to provide singleton behaviour
. Create a private constructor for the subclass
.. Define `cmdArgLevel` and `emptyArgMsg`
.. Construct the switches for the `ArgCommand` and supply them as arguments to `switchInit()`
... If there are no switches, call `switchInit()` with no arguments

Switch values are accessed from the `ArgCommand` with the `getSwitchVal()` method, which takes the name of a switch, as a String, as an argument, and returns the String representing the argument supplied for the switch.

NOTE: If there is no argument given for a switch, `getSwitchVal(<switch name>)` returns `null`. However, if a switch is not given, `getSwitchVal(<switch name>)` also returns `null`. The former case can be distinguished by the fact that `switchVals` will contain `<switch name>` as a key.

==== Parsing

The `Parser` object scans through a user-supplied string. The first word is extracted, and if the corresponding command is an `ArgCommand`, it uses several nested finite state machines (FSMs) which switch on the characters in the input. Switches are extracted, using the aliases in `switchAliases` to identify the full names of the corresponding switches. The switch arguments are then compared against the requirements of the `ArgCommand`, as stored in the `switchMap`.

The finite state machine for input parsing has the following states:

* `EMPTY`: parsing whitespace, which has no semantic meaning aside from serving as a separator
* `ARG`: parsing an argument that is not quoted, which may be for a switch or for the command itself
* `STRING`: parsing an argument that is surrounded by double quotes
* `SWITCH`: parsing a switch name

The state transitions on encountering would not be clearly represented on a state diagram, but can be summarised as follows:

* `EMPTY`
** `EMPTY` -> `EMPTY`: <Newline> or <Space>
** `EMPTY` -> `SWITCH`: `-`
** `EMPTY` -> `STRING`: `"`
** `EMPTY` -> `ARG`: <any other character>
* `SWITCH`
** `SWITCH` -> `EMPTY`: <Newline> or <Space>
** `SWITCH` -> `SWITCH` (add current switch and begin processing a new switch): `-`
** `SWITCH` -> `STRING` (add current switch and begin parsing a string as an argument): `"`
** `SWITCH` -> `SWITCH`: <any other character>
* `STRING`
** `STRING` -> `EMPTY`: `"`
** `STRING` -> `STRING`: <any other character>
* `ARG`
** `ARG` -> `EMPTY`: <Newline> or <Space>
** `ARG` -> `DukeException`: Unescaped `"` or `-`
** `ARG` -> `ARG`: <any other character>

Preceding any transition character with a backslash `\` will escape it, allowing it to be treated as an ordinary character.

When transitioning from `EMPTY` to any other state, `checkInputAllowed()` is used to check if input is allowed at that point. While in the `ARG`, `STRING` or `SWITCH` states, each character that is read is added to a StringBuilder `elementBuilder`. When exiting the state, the string is processed as a switch via `addSwitch()`, or written to the `Command` being constructed as an argument by `writeElement()`. This can be an argument for the `Command` itself, or a switch argument. For more details on how switches are processed, see above on `Command` objects, and on the <<Feature-Switch-Autocorrect,Switch Autocorrect>> feature.

When every character in the input has been consumed, cleanup will be performed based on the state that the `Parser` is in at that point:

* `EMPTY`: nothing is done
* `ARG`: call `writeElement()` to write a command or switch argument
* `SWITCH`: call `addSwitch()` to process the switch name
* `STRING`: call `writeElement()`, assuming the user simply forgot to close the string

[[Design-Model]]
=== Data Model [KWOK KUIN EK JEREMY]

.Class Diagram
image::DataModel.png[]

The Class Diagram shown above describes the relationship among the different data classes invloved in storing
information used in `Dr. Duke`. The class is named after the object it represents. All objects extend the `DukeObject`
abstract class, which stores basic information to identify the object and its parent.

The `DukeObject` class specifies several abstract functions crucial for the UI to access. All `DukeObjects` also have a
`parent` DukeObject which is transient and may be null. This is to facilitate storing in Gson and allow objects to
reference their parent if needed. A `String` representation of `DukeObjects` can be obtained using the `toString` and
`toReportString` methods.

==== Patient
.Class Diagram
image::PatientModel.png[]

The class diagram shown above shows the `Patient` class and how it is stored.

Patients entered into our system are stored as `Patient` objects in our `PatientData` object. This can be converted to
Gson easily after accounting for abstract objects. All patients may have `Impressions` associated with them which are
created by the Doctor's impression of a Patient. This is supported with `DukeData` objects as evidences or treatments.

The `Patient` object should provide the following functionality:
* Input validation to ensure it stores valid input
* Sorting of Impressions
** Currently, Primary Impressions are also stored at the head of the `impressions` list. If a future metric for assessing
importance of impressions are suggested by users, it can be added here as well.
* Filtered list of important critical `DukeData`
* Filtered list of uncompleted `Treatments` which require follow ups
* Quick notes on the Patient

==== Impression

Impressions are what a doctor diagnoses a Patient of. Each impression may be supported by Evidences and associated with
Treatments.

The `Impression` object should provide the following functionality:
* Input validation
* Sorting of Treatments
** High priorities are the first metric
** Incomplete status requiring follow up is the second metric
* Sorting of Evidences
** High priorities are the first metric

==== DukeData
.Class Diagram
image::DukeDataModel.png[]

The diagram above shows the DukeData class and its concrete implementations. The `DukeData` objects represent evidence
and treatment recorded by the doctor.

==== Extension

To define new forms of `DukeData` representing information on the Patient, extend `DukeData` or its abstract subclasses
To define other types of data, extend `DukeObject`.

If the class is abstract and needs to be stored, an adaptor implementing `JsonSerializer` and `JsonDeserializer` for it
needs to be created for Gson storage. Any circular referencing must be stored as transient but must be reinitialised at
launch.

NOTE: By convention, we store invalid values instead of null values to prevent nullptr exceptions. If there are
attributes that may be null, consider returning an empty object instead. E.g. for `String`, return `""`.

==== Design Considerations

We considered how we should store our collections of objects and how we should update our UI when designing our model.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage System [JACOB TORESSON]
image::ClassDiagramData.png[]

This class diagram describes the relationship between the Storage class, `GsonStorage`, the patient class, `Patient`, and the other classes used to describe and handle patient data.

The storage/load mechanism is facilitated by `GsonStorage`. `GsonStorage` uses the Google-developed Java Library `Gson 2.8.6`. `Gson` is a library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their `JSON` representation. It can also be used to convert `JSON` representations back to the equivalent Java` Object. For more information about `Gson` refer to the `Gson` User Guide at https://github.com/google/gson/blob/master/UserGuide.md.

The `JSON` representations of the patients are stored in a `JSON` file called `patients.json`.

`GsonStorage` implements the following operations:

* `HashMap<String, Patient> loadPatientHashMap()`- Loads all the patients in `patients.json` to the hashmap `patientObservableMap`
* `void writeJsonFile(HashMap<String, Patient> patientMap)`- Creates an array containing the patients in `patientObservableMap` and writes the arrays `JSON` representation to `patients.json`
* `String getFilePath()`- returns the filepath to `patients.json`
* `PatientMap resetAllData()`- Clears `patients.json` and returns an empty hash map

When the user boots `Dr.Duke` a `GsonStorage` and a `PatientMap` object is created. The method `loadPatientHashmap` in `GsonStorage` is then executed which extracts all the `JSON` representations of the patients in `patients.json` as a string. The `GSON` method `fromJson()` is then executed on the `JSON` representation of the patients which creates the equivalent java array contaning `Patient` objects. The array is iterated through and every patient is loaded into the `patientObservableMap` attribute of the `PatientMap` object.

During runtime, every new patient that is created is stored in the `patientObservableMap`.

When the user shuts down `Dr.Duke` the `patientObservableMap` is sent back to the `GsonStorage` object by calling the `writeJsonFile` method on the `GsonSotrage` object. The `writeJsonFile` method iterates through the `patientObservableMap` and places every `Patient` object in a java array. When all the patients are in the array the arrays `JSON` representation is created using the `Gson` method `toJson()`. The context of the `patient.son` file is then cleared and the new `JSON` representation of the array containing all the patients is written to the `patient.json` file which concludes the storage circle.

As can be seen in the class diagram, every individual's patient's data in nested from the `Patient` object representing that patient. The diagram also displays that there are no circle references. For these two reasons, using `Gson` to store all the data about the different patients is very convenient and effective as everything can be stored by simply creating the `JSON` representations of each `Patient` object and the rest of the nesting will be parsed automatically by the `Gson` source code.

If further development of `Dr.Duke` requires the storage of other objects that are nested from the patient objects that will be done automatically by the existing storage mechanism as long as there are no circle references. If further development requires storage of objects that are not nested from patient objects the storage mechanism needs to be updated to include two or more arrays instead of one; one containing the `JSON` representations of the `Patient` objects and the other/s containing the `JSON` representation of the other object/s.

[[Design-UI]]
=== UI [PANG JIA JUN VERNON]
The UI for Dr. Duke acts as an abstract layer that exists independently and interacts with the other modules/components of the application via a simple interface. It is designed to be easily expandable with its use of abstract classes that can easily be inherited for the purpose of future development of the application (e.g. addition of contexts / data). The overall UI class diagram is a good place to understand how the UI component is constructed.

.Overall UI class diagram
image::ui_overall.png[]

This overall class diagram aptly describes the relationships between the various core classes/packages in the UI component.

The UI component can be categorised into 3 main parts.

*   `UiManager`
*   Windows
*   Cards

The UI component is exposed to external modules/components via the `Ui` interface. The `UiManager` implements this interface and acts as the manager of the UI component. Hence, `UiManager` holds a reference to the `MainWindow` (the primary UI window that houses the other UI elements that the application will use).

.UI Windows class diagram
image::ui_windows.png[]
As mentioned, the UI is made up of a `MainWindow` that houses various UI elements such as `CommandWindow`, `HomeWindow`, `PatientWindow`, etc. These UI elements, including `MainWindow` extends from the abstract class `UiElement`. This abstract class serves as the parent class for all of the UI elements used in the application, and allows for their easy creation. In addtion, the `MainWindow` holds a reference of the `UiContext` that exposes the current `Context` of the application. This is required as the `Context` of the application determines what UI window is shown, i.e. `HomeWindow` for Home context, `PatientWindow` for Patient context. As Dr. Duke works with a huge number of contexts, the various context windows extend from `ContextWindow`. This greatly enables for the use of polymorphism when dealing with the context windows. Therefore, when dealing with a new context, you, as the developer, should always inherit from `ContextWindow` to display the context in GUI form.

.UI Cards class diagram
image::ui_cards.png[]
The various windows mentioned previously hold the corresponding cards as shown in the diagram above. These cards show an excerpt of the details of the respecitve `DukeObjects`. All cards extend from `UiCard`. What has been mentioned for `ContextWindow` applies to `UiCard` as well.

The UI component executes user commands using the Parser component and listens for changes to Model data so that the UI can be updated with the newly modified data.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI elements are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/duke/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

== Feature Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features in Dr. Duke are implemented.

[[Feature-Switch-Autocomplete]]
=== Contexts [PANG JIA JUN VERNON]
==== Rationale

Dr. Duke aims to assist House Officers in quick, accurate, and efficient recording and retrieval of patient data required to provide efficient care. On a day-to-day basis, house officers deal with a lot of information, ranging from the biometrics details of a patient to the investigation results from a blood test. To make things worse, a house officer also typically has to manage many patients. Therefore, with this information overload, it would be really helpful if the house officer is able to view each piece of information in a very focused setting. This has inspired us to come up with the idea of `Contexts`. In Dr. Duke, there are currently 4 main contexts. They are the `HOME`, `PATIENT`, `IMPRESSION`, and `TREATMENT AND EVIDENCE` contexts (listed in hierarchical order). The different contexts allow the house officer to focus on a particular patient or a particular impression of a patient without being overloaded by other irrelevant information.

==== Implementation
The `Context` mechanism is mainly facilitated by the `UiContext` class. It implements the following operations:

* `UiContext#open()` - Opens and displays a context.
* `UiContext#moveBackOneContext()` - Moves back one context.
* `UiContext#moveUpOneContext()` - Moves up one in the hierarchy of contexts.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the context mechanism behaves accordingly.

Step 1: The user launches the application. The application starts out in the `HOME` context. The user currently manages 3 patients.

Step 2: The user keys in "open 1" in the text field and presses the Enter key. At this point, the parser parses the input and executes the open command. This command invokes the context mechanism.

Step 3: The context mechanism first stores the current context (and the associated `DukeObject`) in a stack (so it can still be accessed later when the user wishes to execute the back command). Then, the context mechanism updates the context to the `PATIENT` context and retrieves the corresponding `Patient` object as selected by the user.

Step 4: The UI component of Dr. Duke listens to changes in the context of the application via an attached `PropertyChangeListener` and updates the current context window from `HomeContextWindow` to the `PatientContextWindow`.

Step 5: The transition to the `PATIENT` context is fully completed.

[[Feature-Switch-Autocorrect]]
=== Switch Autocorrect [JOHN CUTHBERT KHOO TENG FONG]

==== Rationale

While rapidly adding different types of patient data, it is inevitable that typing mistakes will be made. While short forms of switches are accepted in order to minimise the amount of typing that needs to be done to organise information, and therefore the risk of mistakes being made, we still need to account for the cases where they occur. An automated means of correcting the text would allow these corrections to be made as quickly as possible and with minimal effort required from the user, reducing the disruption to his workflow caused by these mistakes.

==== Implementation

If a user-supplied switch is _not_ an alias for any switch, this triggers the disambiguation functions in `CommandHelpers`. We use a modified Levenshtein-Damerau distance which takes into account the taxicab distance between keys on a standard QWERTY keyboard in weighting the cost of substitutions. Pseudocode for the Levenshtein-Damerau distance computation can be found https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1963190.1963191[here] and ideas for implementation of keyboard distance analysis are taken from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29233888/[here]. This provides a realistic measure of the likelihood that a particular mistake was made, as the likelihood of accidentally pressing an incorrect key is dramatically decreased if the incorrect key in question is a keyboard's length away from one's intended key, which is a fact that the basic Levenshtein-Damerau distance algorithm fails to capture.

The distance of the ambiguous string to every alias whose length differs from the string's by at most 2 is calculated. Basic pruning is implemented, terminating the distance estimation computation if it exceeds the minimum distance found so far.

If there is a switch with a unique lowest distance from the input string, that switch is automatically selected, with a warning shown to the user to indicate that his input was autocorrected. If not, the user is prompted with a screen listing the closest matches, as well as all valid switches for this command. The closest matches are numbered, and the user may select one by entering its corresponding number, or he may enter another valid switch in its full form.

==== Comparison with Alternatives

Taxicab distance is used as opposed to Euclidean in order to avoid computing square roots, and only the substitution cost is affected by the keyboard distance, as having missed or accidentally added a character, or typing the characters out of sequence, is not dependent on the distance between two keys.

This function is called by the parser finite state machine whenever a complete switch that does not match any alias is processed, instead of presenting all combinations of possible corrections after the whole input is parsed. This allows mistyped switches to be individually and unambiguously corrected, instead of creating a confusing combinatorical explosion of possible switches if the user makes several mistakes in a complex query, some of which may have more than two close matches for a switch if the user had used their shortened forms.

=== Search all records [KWOK KUIN EK JEREMY]
image::SearchDiagram.png[]

The above diagram shows the information a search result will store and the SearchContext its displayed in.

image::SearchExample.PNG[]

The picture above is an example of a `find` command.

==== Rationale

Dr. Duke aims to assist House Officers in quick, accurate recording and retrieval of patient data required to provide
efficient care. When more patients are added to the system and the system grows in size or the user want to directly
access a piece of nested data we need a method to directly assess the data. Therefore, it makes sense to have a search
function to search through the entire system or a subset of the system. Hence, a find feature is essential for users to
quickly locate data or for disambiguation when it is unclear what the user wants to narrow down the possible options
based on existing data in the system.

* Reduce the time taken for the user to enter details of the Patient and navigate in the system.
* Search a subset of the system or only for data of a certain type.


==== Proposed Implementation
The search mechanism is facilitated by two main functions, namely `contains` and `find`.

`contains` is a method every concrete component of the data model has. It is specific to the type of information stored
by the class. In our case, this facilitates searching for information by representing relevant attributes in String form
and checking if the search term is contained within.

`find` method is included in every class that stores ArrayLists of other objects. It searches if an object contains a
search term by utilising the `contains` method. Different flavours of the `find` function is post fixed with information
on what its purpose is. For example, `findImpressionsByName` searches only the `name` field of `Impression` objects.
The master `find` function is `searchAll` which searches through all related information from a particular object down.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application and navigates to a particular patient context for example, `John`. The `TextField` in the
`CommandWindow` is blank, and the context is `Patient:John`. The user wishes to search `John` for a particular piece of information
e.g. Fever (a sample valid command syntax is `find Fever`).

Step 2: The find method will be called and all data related to the Patient will be searched for `Fever`, It will display the results in a new
Context containing all impressions where `John` had `Fever` in a separate window

Step 3: The user can then select a particular impression and review the information or change the information if desired.

==== Alternatives

* ChainSearching
** Pros: We can instead use the `toString` method to search. Simpler to implement and maintain.
** Cons: However, this may include unnecessary information. Java String have a character limit of 2147483647.
If any String is very long, it may have overflow.

=== Discharge patients and create discharge reports [JACOB TORESSON]

==== Rationale

The discharge feature deletes a patient from `Dr.Duke` and creates a `.txt` report file where all data about the patient at the point of discharge is stored. These report files can be used to manually recreate a patient if a doctor wants to add a discharged patient back to `Dr.Duke`. This feature also prevents `Dr.Duke` from getting full as new patients come and go from the hospital using the same bed numbers. To be able to discharge a patient that is no longer at the hospital also enables quicker lookup of the patients that are at the hospital.

==== Implementation

The discharge mechanism is facilitated by the `ReportCommand` and `ReportSpec` classes. `ReportCommand` extends the `Command` class and `ReportSpec` extends the `ArgSpec` class. Like every command, `ReportCommand` has an `execute` method. The `execute` method is called upon when the user enters a “discharge” command followed by a valid bed number. The “discharge” command has the optional switch `-sum` that enables the user to input a short discharge summary, for example, the reason why the patient is discharged and the date and time of the discharge. As the reports are stored in a text format the user can also add additional text to the report after the report has been created by simply writing new text to the report file with a text editor. The syntax of the “discharge” command is implemented in `ReportSpec` using the `Switch` class.

Given below is an example of what a discharge command with a discharge summary that follows the syntax could look like

* `discharge A12 -sum Patient left the hospital, 2019-03-03 08:00`

The `execute` method in `ReportCommand` creates one report file for each discharged patient and places it in the “report” folder within the “data” folder. Every discharged patient file is named with the patient's name and bed number separated by a `-`. For example, if a patient named “Alexander Smith” with the bed number "A300" was discharged the file name would be `AlexanderSmith-A300`.

The `execute` method uses the `FileWriter` class to write the report to the report file utilizing `toReportString` which is a method that every `DukeObject` implements. The `toReportString` returns a string representation of every attribute that is not a null value and some other strings that make the report more reader-friendly.

==== Alternatives considerations

A future consideration is to store the reports in PDF files instead of text files. This would be beneficial as it would decrease the risk of the user to accidentally change the reports while reading it. Using PDFs could also make the reports more reader-friendly for the user. A drawback of using PDFs is that it makes it harder for the user to add text to the reports after they have been created. Another future consideration is to automatically include the date and time of when each discharge in the reports.

[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

*House officers*, who are typically freshly-graduated medical students, play a vital role in managing hospital patients.
They are responsible, among many other things, for collating all information regarding each hospital patient and
organising it to provide a clear picture of the patient's situation, and for presenting that picture to senior doctors
who can then make assessments and recommendations based on that picture. As much of this information needs to be
exchanged at a rapid pace, *Dr. Duke* assists in quick, accurate and efficient recording and retrieval of the patient
data required to provide effective care.

The house officers we are targeting with this app:

* need to manage a significant number of patients
* need to quickly input and organise patient data
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* prefer typing over mouse input
* can type fast

*Value proposition*:

* input, organise and access information about patients faster than with a typical mouse/GUI driven app

[appendix]
== Non Functional Requirements

. The software should be portable, i.e. work on any <<mainstream-os,mainstream OS>> as long as the OS has Java `11` or
above installed.
. The software should be able to hold up to 500 patients without a noticeable reduction in performance for
typical usage.
. The software should work without internet access.
. The software should have good user documentation, which details all aspects of the software to assist new
users on how to use this software.
. The software should have good developer documentation to allow developers to understand the design of the
software easily so that they can further develop and enhance the software.
. The software should be easily testable.
. A user with an above average typing speed for regular English text should be able to accomplish most of his/her
intended tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
. All data transactions should be atomic - either they succeed and the persistent data storage is immediately updated,
or they fail and the user is notified of that event, with the data being unchanged.

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== `new` commands

. Navigate to the context of the parent of the object you are creating. For patients, this is the `HOME` context.

.. Prerequisites: Creating new objects require their parent objects to already exist. i.e. A `Patient` must exist before
an `Impression` can be created.
.. Test case: `new -n "Wong Jin Tine" -b A018 -a "Dust"` +
    Expected: Remain at `HOME` context. The GUI display remains at `HomeContextWindow`. `CommandWindow` prompts a
    message to notify the user that a patient has been added.
.. Test case: `new -n flu -desc "Patient seems to have sever flu."`
    Expected: Remain at `PATIENT` context. The GUI display remains at `PatientContextWindow`. `CommandWindow` prompts a
     message to notify the user that an impression has been added.
.. Test case: `new -ob -n "Blood Test"`
    Expected: Remain at `IMPRESSION` context. The GUI display remains at `ImpressionContextWindow`. `CommandWindow`
    prompts a message to notify the user that an observation has been added.

=== Navigating between contexts

.  Navigate to `PATIENT` context

.. Prerequisites: Currently at `HOME` context, no previous contexts, and managing at least 1         patient.
.. Test case: `open 1` +
   Expected: Navigate successfully to the `PATIENT` context. The GUI display updates from the `HomeContextWindow` to the `PatientContextWindow`. `CommandWindow` prompts a message to notify the user that he/she has sucessfully navigated to the `PATIENT` context.
.. Test case: `up` +
   Expected: Remains at `HOME` context. The GUI display remains at `HomeContextWindow`. `CommandWindow` prompts a message to notify the user that no context transitions has taken place.
.. Test case: `back` +
   Expected: Remains at `HOME` context. The GUI display remains at `HomeContextWindow`. `CommandWindow` prompts a message to notify the user that no context transitions has taken place.

=== Searching Dr. Duke

.. Prerequisites: Currently at `HOME`, `PATIENT` or `IMPRESSION` context, and managing at least 1 patient.
.. Test case: `find a` +
    Expected: Navigate successfully to the `SEARCH` context, have results which contain the substring 'a'. Note that you
    will remain in the current context if no `DukeObjects` which contain the data exist. `CommandWindow` will feedback
    if the search is successful or not.
