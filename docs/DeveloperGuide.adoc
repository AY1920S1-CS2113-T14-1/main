== Introduction

*Dr. Duke* is a command-line based personal assistant for doctors to manage their patients' data.

It provides house officers with a streamlined notebook environment, which allows them to concentrate on the recording of
patient data with a pre-defined structure.

In order to be a successful *Dr. Duke* developer, you need a general understanding of: +

*  *Dr. Duke*’s architecture and object model
*  The Java framework on which *Dr. Duke* builds on

== Setting up
=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `11`* or above
. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* has a need to manage a significant number of `patients`
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* prefers typing over mouse input
* can type fast
* is extremely comfortable with the usage of CLI apps

*Value proposition*: manage `patients` faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

| Priority | As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can...
| `* * *` | house officer | check my patients’ allergies | issue them with the appropriate medicine

| `* * *` | house officer who has to manage a lot of information | flag and view the critical issues to
follow up for each patient | complete the follow-up(s) as soon as possible

| `* * *` | house officer who has to manage many patients | view the previous medical history of my patients
| understand what has been done to manage/treat their conditions

| `* * *` | house officer who needs to input a lot of data quickly and is prone to mistyping | be able to make typing
errors but still have my input recognised | avoid having to waste time to retype my command

| `* * *` | house officer who needs to input a lot of data quickly and is prone to mistyping | confirm my input type and
modify it quickly if it is incorrect | avoid having to retype or tediously transfer entries that were input in the
wrong place

| `* * *` | house officer who needs to upload records into the hospital’s health system | generate unified reports that
are fully compatible with the system | avoid having to manually input those records

| `* * *` | house officer keeping track of information for my consultant | keep track of whether or not I’ve checked
for the results of certain investigations | make sure the consultant is kept up-to-date

| `* * *` | house officer who has to manage a lot of information | easily link new information and follow-up items to
particular conditions | have a clearer picture of each condition and its corresponding management plan

| `* *` | house officer with a consultant that talks too fast | differentiate the types of input with just a single
control character | avoid having to waste time switching between windows

| `* *` | house officer who has to manage a lot of information | easily view and navigate through data associated with
particular conditions that particular patients have | have a clearer view of what that particular condition is

| `* *` | house officer who needs to input a lot of data quickly and is prone to mistyping | undo my previous commands |
quickly rectify mistakes made when inputting data

| `*` | house officer who has to manage a lot of information | search through all of the records of a patient | find all
the details relevant to a particular aspect of his/her care plan

| `*` | house officer who has to manage many patients | easily view all critical issues all my patients are facing by
level of importance | address them as soon as possible

checked to ensure it is of the right format | always be assured that I am inputting the right commands.

== Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the *System* is `Dr. Duke` and the *Actor* is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

[appendix]
== Non Functional Requirements

.  The software should achieve 99% uptime.
.  The software should be portable, i.e. work on any <<mainstream-os,mainstream OS>> as long as it has Java `11` or
above installed.
.  The software should be able to hold up to 500 patients without a noticeable reduction in performance for
typical usage.
.  A user with an above average typing speed for regular English text should be able to accomplish most of the intended
tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
.  Users should be forced to change their password if they have not changed it in the last 6 months.
