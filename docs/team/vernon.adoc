== Overview
Dr. Duke is a GUI-based personal assistant for house officers to manage their patients' data. It aims to increase the speed at which patient data can be entered, organised, and accessed by providing a powerful and flexible GUI, together with easily understandable visual cues. We believe Dr. Duke will greatly complement the tight workflow of house officers.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the ability to navigate across `Contexts` in the application.
** What it does: Allows the user to switch between contexts ordered in a hierarchical fashion. Each context displays its respective information in a focused manner.
** Justification: One of the primary goals of Dr. Duke is to improve the work processes of house officers. House officers typically manages many patients on a day-to-day basis. Hence, they have to deal with a lot of information from all over the place. The `Context` mechanism is an extremely effective method to provide users with a focused view of the information that they are interested in at any given point in time.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects both existing and planned commands as commands are highly contextual in nature in Dr. Duke. This means that the `open` command in the `HOME` context does not necessarily operate in the same way as the `open` command in the `PATIENT` context. Therefore, it involves an in-depth analysis before actual implementation. In addition, the implementation too is challenging as it requires modifications to existing commands in order for them to work as intended in a given context.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added the `Help` window to provide users with real-time and interactive visual guide on the available commands for each context.

=== Patient

image::Patient.png[Patient]

Shows a detailed view of a `Patient`. The details are displayed in separate panels as seen in the figure above.

* Personal details such as name, age, height, weight, etc.
* List of allergies
* Medical history
* List of `Impressions` with their associated details (the name, an excerpt of its description,
and the number of critical items associated with the Impression)
* List of _critical_ `Treatments` and `Evidences` (of priority 1)
* List of _follow-up_ items, which are items that are not completed and that the user will need to follow up on. These consist of:
** `Plan` items with status less than 2 (a status of 2 indicates completion)
** `Investigation` items (once completed, an `Investigation` would be converted to a `Result`)
** There may be items *duplicated* across the critical and follow-up lists as it is meant to give a view of two different but possibly overlapping categories of items that the user might want to view at a glance.

==== `new` - Add a new Impression for this Patient [[patient-new]]

Format: `new *-n[ame]* "<name>" *-desc[ription]* "<description>" [*-g[o]*]` +

Opens the new Impression's context if `-g[o]` is specified.

**Example**
****
*new* `*-n*` "Dengue Fever" `*-desc*` "High fever and back pain" `*-go*`
****

==== `open` - Open a critical item, a follow-up item, or an Impression [[patient-open]]

Format: `open ("<search string>" | _string_or_idx_ *-c[ritical]* | _string_or_idx_ *-f[ollowup]* | _string_or_idx_ *-im[pression]*)`

If a _<search string>_ is used, items will be searched through by *name*, and results presented and selected as per the <<patient-open, `open`>> command,

**Example**
****
*open* 3 `*-impress*`   (This command opens the third Impression in the Impression list) +
*open* "Hip" `*-crit*`  (This command opens a critical item whose name contains "Hip", or a search window if there are multiple such items) +
*open* "Blood" `*-follow*`  (This command opens a follow-up by search string) +
*open* "Fever"  (This command opens an Impression, critical item or follow-up that contains "fever", displaying all matching results in a search window if there are multiple such items)
****

==== `edit` - Edit details of the Patient [[patient-edit]]

Format: `edit *<switch>* [<new value>] [*<switch>* [<new value>]]* [*-app[end]*]` +

Switches and corresponding new value format:

* `*-h[eight]* <height>`
* `*-w[eight]* <weight>`
* `*-ag[e]* <age>`
* `*-num[ber]* <number>`
* `*-ad[dress]* "<address>"`
* `*-hi[story]* "<history>"`
* `*-a[llerg(y | ies)]* "<allergies>"`

If `*-app*` is selected, the `<new value>` of *ALL* string-valued fields will be appended to their current values.

**Example**
****
*edit* `*-height*` 180 `*-weight*` 60 `*-history*` "Dengue Fever" `*-app*`    (changes the Patient's height and weight to the respective numbers shown, and appends "Dengue Fever" to his existing history).
****

==== `find` - Find items matching certain criteria [[patient-find]]

Format: `find ["<search string>"] [_type_]` +
`_type_` -> (`*-im[pression]*` | `*-e[vidence]*` | `*-t[reatment]*`)

Display a list of all Impressions, Treatments, and Evidence belonging to this Patient that match the criteria specified in the search.
If none of the `_type_` switches are used, all types of objects will be listed.
If at least one of them is listed, only objects whose type is used as a switch will be listed.

**Example**
****
*find* "aspirin" `*-im*` (This command searches for Impressions) +
*find* "blood" `*-e*` (This command searches for Evidences) +
*find* "high" (This command searches for Impressions, Evidences, and Treatments)
****

=== UI
The `UI` component for Dr. Duke is an abstract model/layer that exists independently in the application. It interacts with the other components (i.e. Model, Logic, Storage) of the application via a simple interface. It is designed to be easily expanded or modified by other developers with its liberal use of abstract classes. Hence, future developments such as the addition of `Contexts` can be accomplished with ease.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI elements are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/duke/ui/window/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

The `UI` component executes user commands using the `Parser` component and listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the newly modified data.

The overall UI class diagram shown below is a good starting point to understand how the UI component is designed and constructed.

.Overall UI class diagram
image::ui_overall.png[]

This overall class diagram aptly describes the relationships between the various core classes and packages of the UI component.

The UI component can be categorised into 3 main parts.

*   `UiManager`
*   `Windows`
*   `Cards`

The UI component is exposed to other components of Dr. Duke via the `Ui` interface. The `UiManager` implements this interface and acts as the manager of the UI component. `UiManager` holds a reference to the `MainWindow` (the primary UI window that houses the other UI elements that the application will use).

.UI Windows class diagram
image::ui_windows.png[]

As mentioned, the `MainWindow` houses various UI elements such as the `CommandWindow`, `ContextWindow`, and `HelpWindow`. The `MainWindow` holds a reference of the `UiContext` object that exposes the current `Context` (a core feature) of the application. The `Context` of the application determines what UI window the `ContextWindow` takes on, i.e. `HomeWindow` for Home context, `PatientWindow` for Patient context, etc. As Dr. Duke works with a huge number of contexts, the various context windows extend from `ContextWindow`. This greatly enables the use of polymorphism when dealing with the context windows. Therefore, when implementing a new context, you, as the developer, should always inherit from `ContextWindow` to display the context in GUI format.

.UI Cards class diagram
image::ui_cards.png[]

The `ContextWindow` houses the various cards shown in the figure above (corresponding to their respective context). These cards show an excerpt of the details of the `DukeObjects` they represent. All cards extend from `UiCard`. Hence, what has been mentioned with regards to polymorphism for `ContextWindow` applies to `UiCard` as well.

=== Contexts
==== Rationale

Dr. Duke aims to assist house officers in quick, accurate, and efficient recording and retrieval of patient data required to provide efficient care. On a day-to-day basis, house officers deal with a lot of information, ranging from the biometrics details of a patient to the investigation results of a blood test. Therefore, it would be really helpful if they are able to view these chunks of information in a very focused setting. This has inspired us to come up with the idea of `Contexts`. In Dr. Duke, there are currently four main contexts. They are the `HOME`, `PATIENT`, `IMPRESSION`, and `TREATMENT AND EVIDENCE` contexts (listed in hierarchical order). The different contexts allow the house officers to focus on a particular patient or a particular impression of a patient at hand without being overloaded by other irrelevant information.

==== Implementation
The `Context` mechanism is facilitated by the `UiContext` class. It implements the following operations:

* `UiContext#open(DukeObject)` - Opens and displays a context.
* `UiContext#moveBackOneContext()` - Moves back one context.
* `UiContext#moveUpOneContext()` - Moves up one in the hierarchy of contexts.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the context mechanism behaves accordingly.

image::context_sequence.png[Sequence diagram for `Context` mechanism]

Step 1: The user launches the application. The application (`UiContext`) starts out in the `HOME` context. The user currently manages 3 patients.

Step 2: The user keys in "open 1" in the text field and presses the Enter key. At this point, the `Parser` parses the input and passes a `open` command to the `Executor` for execution. This command invokes the context mechanism.

Step 3: The `Context` mechanism first stores the current context (and the associated `DukeObject`) in a stack (so it can still be accessed later when the user wishes to execute the `back` command). Then, it updates the context to the `PATIENT` context and retrieves the corresponding `Patient` object as selected by the user.

Step 4: The `UI` component of Dr. Duke listens to changes in the context of the application via an attached `PropertyChangeListener` and updates the current context window from `HomeContextWindow` to the `PatientContextWindow`.

Step 5: The transition to the `PATIENT` context is fully completed.

==== Comparison with Alternatives

We could possibly adopt the same format used by most existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) system and put all information regarding a patient in a single display screen. This will, without a doubt, significantly simplify the internal workings of Dr. Duke. However, the application will become cluttered and unintuitive to the users.
