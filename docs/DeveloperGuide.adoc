== Introduction

*Dr. Duke* is a command-line based personal assistant for house officers to quickly and efficiently manage their patients' data.

It provides house officers with a streamlined notebook environment, which allows them to concentrate on the recording of
patient data with a pre-defined structure.

In order to be a successful *Dr. Duke* developer, you need a general understanding of: +

*  *Dr. Duke*'s architecture and object model
*  The Java framework which *Dr. Duke* builds on

== Setting up
=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `11`* or above
. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

House officers, who are typically freshly-graduated medical students, play a vital role in managing hospital patients. They are responsible, among many other
things, for collating all information regarding each hospital patient and organising it to provide a clear picture of the patient's situation, and for
presenting that picture to senior doctors who can then make assessments and recommendations based on that picture. As much of this information needs to be
exchanged at a rapid pace, Dr. Duke assists in quick, accurate and efficient recording and retrieval of the patient data required to provide effective care. 

The house officers we are targeting with this app:

* need to manage a significant number of patients
* need to quickly input and organise patient data
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* prefer typing over mouse input
* can type fast

*Value proposition*: input, organise and access information about patients faster than with a typical mouse/GUI driven app

| Priority | As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can...
| `* * *` | house officer | check my patients' allergies | issue them with the appropriate medicine

| `* * *` | house officer who has to manage a lot of information | flag and view the critical issues to
follow up for each patient | complete the follow-up(s) as soon as possible

| `* * *` | house officer who has to manage many patients | view the previous medical history of my patients
| understand what has been done to manage/treat their conditions

| `* * *` | house officer who needs to input a lot of data quickly and is prone to mistyping | be able to make typing
errors but still have my input recognised | avoid having to waste time to retype my command

| `* * *` | house officer who needs to input a lot of data quickly and is prone to mistyping | confirm my input type and
modify it quickly if it is incorrect | avoid having to retype or tediously transfer entries that were input in the
wrong place

| `* * *` | house officer who needs to upload records into the hospital's health system | generate unified reports that
are fully compatible with the system | avoid having to manually input those records

| `* * *` | house officer keeping track of information for my consultant | keep track of whether or not I've checked
for the results of certain investigations | make sure the consultant is kept up-to-date

| `* * *` | house officer who has to manage a lot of information | easily link new information and follow-up items to
particular conditions | have a clearer picture of each condition and its corresponding management plan

| `* *` | house officer with a consultant that talks too fast | differentiate the types of input with just a single
control character | avoid having to waste time switching between windows

| `* *` | house officer who has to manage a lot of information | easily view and navigate through data associated with
particular conditions that particular patients have | have a clearer view of what that particular condition is

| `* *` | house officer who needs to input a lot of data quickly and is prone to mistyping | undo my previous commands |
quickly rectify mistakes made when inputting data

| `*` | house officer who has to manage a lot of information | search through all of the records of a patient | find all
the details relevant to a particular aspect of his/her care plan

| `*` | house officer who has to manage many patients | easily view all critical issues all my patients are facing by
level of importance | address them as soon as possible

| `*` | house officer who needs to input a lot of data quickly and is prone to mistyping | have my input automatically
checked to ensure it is of the right format | always be assured that I am inputting the right commands.

== Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the *System* is `Dr. Duke` and the *Actor* is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

[appendix]
== Non Functional Requirements

.  The software should be portable, i.e. work on any <<mainstream-os,mainstream OS>> as long as it has Java `11` or
above installed.
.  The software should be able to hold up to 500 patients without a noticeable reduction in performance for
typical usage.
.  A user with an above average typing speed for regular English text should be able to accomplish most of the intended
tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
*  All data transactions should be atomic - either they succeed and the persistent data storage is immediately updated,
or they fail and the user is notified of that event, with the data being unchanged.

// TODO: Remove for final version
